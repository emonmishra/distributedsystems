Essentially there are three pieces to this technology:
F = Set of elements in a Finite field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field)
E(r,c) = Encoding Matrix consisting of elements only from F with row r and column c
x = input data
y = bytes stored on disk

E is a special type of matrix with below properties:
* All square-sub-matrices of E should be invertible e.g. E(5,3) will have 10 (5 choose 3) square sub-matrices and all of them need to be invertible. 
* It contains elements from finite fields which helps reducing the size of y

derive y using below equation:
E.x = y

then store y on disk by distributing each row of y on separate machines (S1...Sn) and maintain that mapping M somewhere because corresponding row from E will be used to recover x

to get back x:
* read from subset of machines  where y was stored
* get sub-matrix Es of E corresponding such that machines Sk from where y was read represents row k in E
* invert Es
* the recover x using (Esi).y = x; where Esi is inverse matrix of Es
